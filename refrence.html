            <p>Front end development is the core field of computer science development that primarily focuses on coding and building what is 
                visible,mainly in web apps or websites.A front end developer is a person in charge of designing the layout or schema for these types of apps.
                Front-end web development is the development of the graphical user interface of a website, through the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
                so that users can view and interact with that website.frontend developer must work with back-end engineers manage the servers,instances, 
                databases,and storage that modern applications and sites run on.</p>

                    <h2>Backend<hr></h2>
                <p>The backend is the server side of the website.It stores and arranges data, and also makes sure everything on the
                     client side of the website works fine.It is part of the website that you cannot see and interact with.It is the portion of 
                     software that does not come in direct contact with the users.The parts and characteristics developed by backend designers are 
                     indirectly accessed by users through a front-end application.Activities,like writing APIs,creating libraries
                    ,and working with system components without user interfaces or scientific programming,
                     are included in the backend.</p>

                        <h2>Full stack<hr></h2>
                    <p>Full stack development is the end-to-end development of applications. It includes both the front end and back end of an 
                        application.The front end is usually accessed by a client,and the back end forms the core of the application where all 
                        the business logic is applied.They are responsible for coding end-to-end workflows by using both front-end and back-end technologies. 
                        <b>MERN</b> stack and <b>MEAN</b> stack are examples of JavaScript-based technology stacks that full stack developers can use to build end-to-end applications</p>
